# 1) What is the primary goal of data anonymization?

# %%
To protect privacy by removing personal information from data.


# %% [markdown]
# 2) What is the Havasupai Tribe case about?

# %% [markdown]
# The Havasupai Tribe is a Native American community living in the Grand Canyon. Researchers from ASU collected blood samples from the tribe for a study about type 2 diabetes. However, without consent they used the blood samples for additional studies, violating the tribe's cultural and spirtual beliefs.

# 4. What is the pulse oximeter controversy about?

# %% [markdown]
#   Pulse oximeters are less accurate for people with darker skin tones, leading to undetected low oxygen levels in certain patients.

# 5. What is the role of an Institutional Review Board (IRB) in research?

# %% [markdown]
# They are committees that review and monitor research involving human subjects. They are in charge of safeguarding the rights and welfare of research subjects.

# %% [markdown]
# 6. What is the difference between spreadsheet software and database software for health data management?

# %% [markdown]
# Spreadsheet software is best for smaller datasets, while database software is best for large, complex data.

# %% [markdown]
# 7. What is a conflict of interest in public health research?

# %% [markdown]
# A situation where a person or orginization involved in the research has a secondary interest that could unduly influence or bias the conduct.

# %% [markdown]
# 8. What is informed consent in the context of health data collection?

# %% [markdown]
# All individuals are fully informed about how their data will be collected, used, stored, and shared.

# %% [markdown]
# 9. What is data masking in the context of de-identification of health data?

# %% [markdown]
# Data masking is the process of hiding or altering sensitive information, to protect against identification.

# %% [markdown]
# 10. What is the principle of k anonymity in the context of de-identification of health data?

# %% [markdown]
# Reduces the risk of identification by ensuring individuals in a dataset cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 other individuals.

# %% [markdown]
# 11. What is the main concern about conflicts of interest in public health research?

# %% [markdown]
# It can reduce trust in public health decisions, and bias research findings.

# %% [markdown]
# 12. What is the first step in managing conflicts of interest in public health research?

# %% [markdown]
# Full disclosure of any potential conflicts of interest by researchers/organizations involved in the study.

# %% [markdown]
# 13. What is the role of independent oversight in managing conflicts of interest in public health research?

# %% [markdown]
# Independent oversight helps ensure that research decisions are unbiased and ethical.

# %% [markdown]
# 14. What is one strategy for mitigating conflicts of interest in public health research?

# %% [markdown]
# Requiring independent data analysis or review by researchers who do not have a financial or personal stake in the research.

# Misuse of Health Data Example

# %% [markdown]
# Henrietta Lacks was a Black woman whose cancer cells were taken in 1951 without her knowledge or consent while she was receiving treatment. These cells, known as HeLa cells, became the first immortal human cell line and were widely used in medical research, including the development of vaccines such as the polio vaccine. Neither Lacks nor her family were informed or compensated for decades.
# The ethical issues include lack of informed consent, exploitation, and racial inequality in medical research. Her biological data and cells were used for enormous scientific and commercial benefit, while her family remained unaware and underserved by the healthcare system. This reflects a broader pattern of marginalized groups being used in research without protection.
# This could have been prevented by enforcing informed consent standards, respecting patient autonomy, and ensuring transparency in research practices. Strong ethical review boards and legal protections for patients’ biological data would have helped prevent this misuse and protect patient rights.

# Health Data Breach

# %% [markdown]
# In 2015, Premera Blue Cross experienced a cyberattack that exposed the data of approximately 11 million people. Hackers gained access to names, addresses, birth dates, Social Security numbers, and bank account information. The breach went undetected for months.
# The consequences included identity theft risks, lawsuits, and significant financial costs related to recovery and monitoring services. Patients lost trust in the insurer’s ability to protect extremely sensitive personal information.
# Prevention could have included better intrusion detection systems, timely patching of known vulnerabilities, and encryption of sensitive data. Regular penetration testing and stronger internal security policies would also have reduced the impact.

# Health Data Bias

# %% [markdown]
# Historically, heart disease research and diagnostic criteria were based largely on male patients. As a result, women’s symptoms—such as fatigue, nausea, or jaw pain—were often underrepresented in datasets and clinical guidelines. This led to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis in women.
# The consequences included higher mortality rates and poorer outcomes for women experiencing heart attacks. Many women were dismissed or misdiagnosed because their symptoms did not match the “classic” male-centered presentation.
# This bias could have been prevented by ensuring gender-balanced clinical trials, updating diagnostic guidelines using inclusive data, and training clinicians to recognize diverse symptom patterns. Ongoing review of datasets for representation gaps is also critical.

# Anonymization of Health Data

# %% [markdown]
# Differential privacy is an anonymization technique that adds carefully calibrated statistical “noise” to health data before it is shared. This allows researchers to analyze population-level trends without revealing information about any specific individual.
# For example, public health agencies may release statistics about disease rates while slightly altering counts so individuals cannot be re-identified, even when datasets are combined with outside information. The overall accuracy remains useful for research.
# This technique is especially effective because it provides mathematical guarantees of privacy protection. It is increasingly used in large-scale health data sharing to balance data utility with strong privacy safeguards
